### Technical Details: Creating LibreCrypt Volumes

To create a container file, a fairly significant amount of information is required due to freedom that LibreCrypt gives you in creating volume files. 

Broadly speaking, creating a container consists of three distinct stages:

1. Creating a file large enough on the local filesystem to store the encrypted partition image (and CDB, if included as part of the volume).
1. Writing a CDB either to the volume file or a separate keyfile, depending on the user's choice.
1. Mounting the volume, formatting it, and "shredding" (overwriting) all free space.
                                         

Stage 1 is straightforward; write data to the file until is has gained the required size. This stage is skipped in the case of creating a hidden volume or volume based on a partition.

Stage 2 is more complex; and is described below.

Stage 3 is required in set the volume up for use, and increase security. This is largely a manual process carried out by the user, depending on their needs.

#### Writing the CDB/keyfile
</A>

The following procedure is used to build up a container CDB/keyfile:

1. Obtain all the information which will be stored within the volume's "Volume details block"
1. Derive the "critical data key" by processing the user's password and salt with PKCS #5 PBKDF2 (using HMAC with the user's choice of hash algorithm).
		The derived key should be **ks** bits long (i.e. the cypher's keysize). If **ks** is undefined, then 512 bits will be used. (Note: In this case, the keysize used for encrypting/decrypting the encrypted partition image must be specified by the user. The keysize for the critical data block is fixed at 512 bits if **ks** is undefined in order to simplify the "mount volume" dialog, and to reduce the potential for user confusion as most cyphers have a fixed **ks**, and asking users for this information may cause them to think this is more information they have to memorise, which it wouldn't be)
1. Create the plaintext version of the "Volume details block" in memory, including padding the end with random data as appropriate
1. Calculate the check MAC using HMAC, together with the derived key and user's choice of hash algorithm
1. Truncate the MAC to 512 bits if it is longer, or right-pad to 512 bits with random data to if less.
1. Prepend the check MAC (and any random data appended to it) onto the beginning of the volume details block to form a plaintext version of the "Encrypted block"
1. Encrypt the plaintext "Encrypted block" using a null IV and the critical data key.
1. Prepend the salt bytes onto the end of the "Encrypted block", and pad out the end with random data to form the complete CDB
1. Write the CDB to either:
	 * The start of the user's volume
	 * A keyfile
	 * The user specified offset within the host volume, if creating a "hidden volume" which includes a CDB
