## Appendix D: Glossary

*CDB*

Acronym: Critical Data Block

See "Critical Data Block"

*Critical Data Block*

AKA "CDB"

The header of FreeOTFE format containers. A block of data holding data vital to the correct opening and use of an encrypted partition (container). Among other things, a container's CDB contains the master key used for encrypting/decrypting data as it is written/read from a the container. CDBs are *encrypted*. A full description of what LibreCrypt stores in its CDBs can be found in the [Technical Details](technical_details.htm#technical_details) section.

*LES file*

Linux Encryption Settings file; a text file in which encryption settings for Linux containers are held. Created by using the "Load..."/"Save..." buttons on the password entry dialog when opening Linux containers.

*OTFE*

Acronym: On The Fly Encryption

Any of a number of encryption systems where data is stored on disk in encrypted format. When it is read in from disk, it is transparently decrypted "on the fly" before user applications receive it. In a similar manner, when applications, etc write data back to the disk, it is automatically encrypted before being written.
