# Appendix A: Version History

* LibreCrypt v6.3β (TBD)
	* Separated open and create hidden container dialogs from non-hidden ones - makes both dialogs simpler and less confusing
	* Added experimetal feature to create LUKS containers.
	* Bug fixes
	* improved dm-crypt dialog


* LibreCrypt v6.2β (2015)
	* Renamed to 'LibreCrypt'
	* Fixed bug with minimise on start not working
	* Fixed bug with double click of drive not opening Windows Explorer
	* Reworked new password form, add password strength meter and fix tab order.
	
	
* DoxBox v6.1β (17 April 2015)
  * Security improvements  
     * Ensured any new container is overwritten with Secure PRNG 'chaff' before use by default. This enables plausible deniability of hidden containers, and also hides the amount of data stored in the container. DoxBox (FreeOTFE) container only.
     * Fix bug where the app was contacting the internet for documentation and for updates without a prompt
     * Rework internal handling of secure data (e.g keys and IVs) so all sensitive data is wiped in memory immediately after use. This reduces the risk of leaking to swap, hibernation file, and of cold-boot attacks.   
     
  * UI Improvements
     * Fixed issue with translations - updated gettext to Delphi 2009 version (see build notes)
     * Prompts to format new containers after creation.
     * Many minor UI improvements.    
     * Much refactoring to ease future work.

  * FreeOTFE is now available both as a full installation package, as well as standard ZIP version. 
  * Added LRW and XTS cypher mode support
  * Added post mount/pre dismount/post dismount autorun option to allow automated integrity checking, cleanup, etc 
  * Added option to explore drive automatically after mounting
  * Made volume file timestamp reversion optional (i.e. the timestamps on volume files are automatically set back to their pre-mount values on dismounting; previously it would always do this) 
  * Simplified password entry for mounting FreeOTFE volumes; advanced options can easily be displayed by clicking button. (Advanced mount options can be displayed by default by setting relevant option) 
  * Password entry dialog is now only dismissed when the volume is successfully mounted, or the user cancels the mount when mounting a FreeOTFE volume
  * Multiple driver files can now be selected for installation when manually installing drivers 
  * "File | Mount" now also auto detects LUKS volumes, so they can be mounted via this menu-item as well as "File | Linux volume | Mount file...". Similarly, dragging and dropping files onto FreeOTFE will cause it to attempt to auto detect the type of volume used. 
  * Manually installed drivers will now start up as soon as they've been installed, and set to startup automatically on boot
  * Removed short password warning when mounting a LUKS volume with less than 20 characters in its password
  * Command line option to mount volumes will now accept relative paths to volume files

  * Updated LibTomCrypt based cypher/hash drivers to use LibTomCrypt v1.17    

* v2.00.00 (18th March 2007)

  * Implemented support for Windows Vista (although previous versions would work under Vista, they had a few minor cosmetic issues under this OS) 
  * Added option to allow mounted volumes to be visible to all logged on users, or just the current user 
  * Added option to associate ".vol" files with FreeOTFE, in line with the PDA version, and defaulted open/save dialog filters. (Note that you are still free to use **any** filename with any filename extension).
  * Added ability to store FreeOTFE settings in different places, or not at all if required 
  * Updated to automatically prompt user if they want to start portable mode if the main FreeOTFE driver isn't installed/running
  * Added indicator to show portable mode activating

  * Added option to suppress prompting for volume type when volume files are drag 'n' dropped onto FreeOTFE
  * Added additional prompt when creating new volumes to make it clearer when the minimum amount of information required had been entered
  * Added option to allow user to specify where their settings should be stored (if they are to be saved)
  * Added extra support for "odd" LUKS volumes which don't use the same cypher keylength for IV generation as encrypting data (e.g. volumes which use Blowfish-448 for data encryption, and cbc-essiv:sha256 actually use Blowfish-256 for their ESSIV IVs - this is now supported) 
  * Added detection of (nonstandard) Tiger and Whirlpool hashes when using LUKS volumes
  * Removed redundant warning about drivers not being started in portable mode when they had been manually installed
  * Corrected minor cosmetic issue with status bar display
  * Added OS version ID to human readable CDB dumps
  * Moved weaker drivers (FreeOTFE4PDAHashNull.dll, FreeOTFE4PDACypherNull.dll and FreeOTFE4PDACypherXOR.dll) into a "weak drivers" directory; most users shouldn't use these drivers, but they're still included in the release if needed

* v1.60.00 (28th January 2006)
  
  * Added the following cyphers:
    * CAST6 (Gladman library)
  * Fixed minor bug that prevented FreeOTFE from properly dismounting volumes under certain conditions.

    * Added the following cyphers:
      + Serpent
      + AES (Gladman library)
      + RC-6 (Gladman library) 
      + Twofish (Gladman library)
      + MARS (Gladman library; source only pending licence clarification)
    *  Updated to allow volumes to be mounted across networks
    *  Added ability to resize the driver control dialog
    *  Corrected fault that prevented LUKS partitions from being mounted
    *  Added support for LUKS volumes which use ESSIV, subject to the hashlength of the ESSIV hash generating the same number or less bits as the cypher used. Note: Although LUKS can create volumes with ESSIV - ESSIV is **not** part of the LUKS specification! 
    *  Corrected errors that were displayed when a non-admin attempted to access the driver control dialog
    
* v1.00.00 (20th November 2005)
    * Added dismount hotkeys.
    * Added optional system tray icon (tasktray icon), together with ability to minimize/close FreeOTFE to the system tray.

    * Improved support for MS Windows XP Themes
    * Switched from Delphi 5 to Delphi 7
    
* v0.59.00 BETA (29th July 2005)

  * Minor change to FreeOTFE.sys device driver to fix error introduced by compiler. Specifically, debug builds work correctly, but for release builds the compiler handles the "%" (modulus) operator differently for 64 bit arithmetic; calling a kernel function ("_alldvrm") that doesn't exist in Windows 2000, causing the driver to fail to load. 

* v0.58.00 BETA (24th July 2005)

  * Added support for cryptlib (cl32.dll) as an RNG, if installed
  * Added support for Linux LUKS volumes
  * Removed redundant warnings when run by a user without Administrative privileges

* v0.57.9900 BETA (8th June 2005 - restricted test release)

  * Added support for encrypted CDs/DVDs
  * Added support for encrypting disk devices, as well as partitions (i.e. You can now encrypt an entire disk, not just partitions held on it)
  
* v00.57.00 BETA (28th May 2005)
  * Compatibility with Linux volumes improved
  * Fixed bug found when creating a new volume and storing the volume's CDB separately. (The CDB file wasn't being created before the CDB was written to it, causing an "Unable to write critical data block" error.)   

* v00.56.00 BETA (7th May 2005 - restricted release)
  * Corrected issues relating to formatting volumes

* v00.54.00 BETA (7th May 2005 - restricted release)

    * Now tested under Windows 2000, as well as Windows XP.
    * Removed buffering between data transfers to increase reliability.
    * Updated to fix "Format incomplete" problems when formatting as FAT/FAT32 while running under Windows 2000.
    * Added warning to user if an attempt is made to use a volume file created with a later volume format layout ID.
    * Corrected fault with Windows XP/Windows 2000 differing QueryDosDevice behaviour that sometimes prevented FreeOTFE listing all cyphers/hash algorithms installed.
    * Updated to only accept drag 'n dropped files when the drivers are active.
    * Extra checks included to ensure user has at least one hash and cypher driver installed and running.
    * Fixed MB/GB selection in new volume creation.
    * More sensible saving/loading of Linux encryption settings.
    * Added prompt when exiting if volumes are still mounted.
    
* v00.53.00 BETA (24th April 2005 - restricted release)

    * Fixed major bug causing the main driver to ignore its queue when large amounts of data were written to an encrypted volume.
    * Improved emergency dismount (dismounts faster by cancelling all queued requests to the driver).
    * Improved progress dialog's responsiveness when overwriting free space, preventing it from appearing frozen and giving user a better indication of progress.
    * Fixed minor cosmetic fault on the keyfile creation dialog.
    * FreeOTFE volume creation wizard now gives user more flexibility to specify the sector IV generation method used.
    * Added support for Linux dm-crypt volumes (e.g. ESSIV).
    * Added progress dialog when creating volume files.
    * Message shown when FreeOTFE exits and stops portable mode no longer displayed, unless there was a problem stopping portable mode.

    
* v00.50.00 BETA 1 (4th April 2005)

    * Implementation of "portable mode"
    * Added support for keyfiles
    * User passwords are no longer displayed; they are blanked out with "*" characters
    * Added option to backup and restore the CDB from volumes with a CDB
    * Added option to dump critical data block to a human readable file
    * Driver control dialog now indicates state of drivers - making it a **lot** clearer what's happening!
    * Added support for encrypted partitions
    * User can now change their passwords, and many other FreeOTFE volume properties.   
    * When volume files are mounted and used, their timestamps (created, last accessed and last modified) and attributes are recorded. They are then reset on dismount. 
    * Volume file timestamps and attributes are reset after dismounting, improving "plausible deniability"
    * Added ability to save settings when mounting Linux volumes
    * Volumes can now be mounted as removable drives (no recycle bin, files deleted directly)
    * User's password is now processed with PKCS#5 PBKDF2 (HMAC), instead of being salted and hashed.
    * Improved handling if more than one hash/cypher can be used for encryption/decryption.   
    * Added the following cyphers:
      + DES
      + 3DES
      + Blowfish
      + RC6
      + CAST5
      + libtomcrypt version of Twofish
    * Added the following hash algorithms:
      + Tiger
      + Whirlpool
    * Added per-volume IVs
    * Rewrote most of the driver control dialog
    * Critical data block checksum now uses the HMAC of the volume details block, instead of its hash
    * Fixed bug that could cause new volumes to be created with an extra newline tacked onto the end of the user's password. If you have problems mounting volumes created like this, you should still be able to mount them by entering an extra newline (just press &lt;ENTER&gt;) at the end of your password.
    * Fixed bug that caused VolumeFlags to be read back from the volume incorrectly. In order to continue support for older (CDB format 1) volumes, these volumes will still be read incorrectly, but newer (CDB format 2) volumes are processed correctly. To update older volumes to use the later CDB format, simply change your password via the "Tools | Change volume/keyfile password/details..." menu-item. It is highly recommended that you do this anyway, in order to better ensure future compatibility 
    
* v0.00.02 BETA 1 (11th October 2004)
    * Fix to correct bug with salt handling which prevented FreeOTFE volumes from being mounted.

* v0.00.01 BETA 1 (10th October 2004)
    * First public release for compatibility testing
